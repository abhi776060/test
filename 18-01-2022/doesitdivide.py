Problem Statement: Consider a permutation of numbers from 1 to N written on a paper. Let’s denote the product of its element as ‘prod’ and the sum of its elements as ‘sum’. Given a positive integer N, your task is to determine whether ‘prod’ is divisible by ‘sum’ or not.

Input Format: First input will be an integer T.  It depicts a number of test cases. Followed by value for each test case. Each test case will contain an integer N (1<= N <=10^9). It is nothing but the length of the permutation.
Output Format: For each test case, print “YEAH” if ‘prod’ is divisible by ‘sum’, otherwise print “NAH”.

    if n>=1 and n<=(10**9):

        sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            prod = prod*i
            sum = sum+i
